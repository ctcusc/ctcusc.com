        At USC, if CTC isn't the right fit, there are plenty of other student
        organizations to check out. There are many tech-focused groups for
        aspiring developers and designers such as CAIS++, AthenaHacks, Lavalab,
        Scope, Innovative Design, etc. There are also many social impact focused
        groups such as LACI, 180 degrees consulting, JEP, etc. We'll also be
        hosting events and discussions on social impact which are totally open
        to the public.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't go to USC, there are also other great student organizations
        focused on social impact and technology, including Blueprint at UC
        Berkeley, University of Waterloo, UCLA, Hack4Impact at University of
        Pennsylvania, Cornell University, UIUC, Georgia Tech, and Code 4 Good at
        MIT.
