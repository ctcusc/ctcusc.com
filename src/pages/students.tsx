    question: 'How does CTC work?',
    answer:
      'All active CTC members are split into teams and assigned a nonprofit to work with for the year. Teams vary in size depending on the scope of the project, but all will have 1 Product Manager, 1 Tech Lead, and multiple developers + designers.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How much experience do I need?',
    answer:
      'None! We care more about potential and passion than experience. We encourage all undergraduate students to apply. All new members go through onboarding and are paired with a mentor to work on project tasks together.',
  },
  {
    question: 'Can I apply for more than one role?',
    answer:
      'Unfortunately, no. However, many members try multiple roles across their different projects at CTC.',
  },
  {
    question: "I'm not a CS major. Can I still apply?",
    answer:
      'Please! While many of our members are Computer Science or Design-related majors, we have no preferences for major, year, background, experience level. We review every application we get.',
  },
  {
    question:
      "I'm not sure that I want to apply right now. Can I apply in the spring?",
    answer: 'No, sadly we will be midway through our projects by then.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What can I expect in terms of time commitment/workload?',
    answer:
      "2-5 hours weekly. You'll attend weekly General Meetings and weekly team meetings, and be assigned bi-weekly tickets (tasks) for your project. Projects run from October-April.",
  },
  {
    question: 'How can I meet members to learn more?',
    answer:
      "We'll be at Viterbi's Spring Get Connected Fair on January 13th! In addition, we'll be hosting a number of technical workshops throughout the semester for anyone interested in learning more about what we do!",
  },
